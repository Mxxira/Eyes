# Eyes
-This is the example for the eyes exercise we completed in the first half of the MIT bootcamp.
-This project taught me more in the realm of Javascript and how to do different types of simulation. In contrast to the pacmen exercise, this taught me how to correlate the mouse direction with the movement of the eye, which was different to just clicking a button in the pacmen exercise. I hope you enjoy!
